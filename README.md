# Hamoye_StageE_project
*The last stage of Hamoye Data storytelling internship is perhaps the most exciting of them all as i learnt a lot about data curation and creation.*

*Amazon is a popular e-commerce platform where books are sold. The aim of this project is to unravel what type of books were bought frequently, between 2009 and 2019. The data needed for this project is available on the Amazon website and the project requires that I juxtapose between the number of books displayed for sale, and the type of books bought frequently by consumers.* 

*The Curation of the Data needed for this project is key to successfully answering of the research questions posed. In this report, I document the data curation processes which includes data extraction and collection from Amazon through web scraping, data reasoning, cleaning and transformation and finally resubmission of curated data to a source where other users of the data can access and use it.* 

*The aim is to deliver curated and annotated datasets for users as well as preparation and development of workflows that provides example of useful data analysis methods will also allow users to perform their own data curation and analysis.* 

### Project Implementation. 

***Stating Data Sources**: Data for this project was gotten from Amazon, an e-commerce website 
where books are sold. The webpage that contains data as regards the required data for the project is a webpage that shows the best-selling books on the Amazon website. These serves the right purpose for our analysis as the best-selling books are the most frequently bought books on Amazon.*

***Data Extraction and Collection**: I used Python packages for web scraping which includes Selenium, BeautifulSoup to extract data from the webpages specified. I scraped the rank for all of the books, the book title, author’s name, number of reviews, rating per book, the type of book cover and finally, the cost of owning the book.*
*I used workflows that employ text mining capabilities for searching, refinement and curation of the extracted data.*

**Data Curation and Reasoning**: Using workflows provided in Jupyter notebook and which covers exercises such as extraction of specific data, cleaning and transformation, data visualization and resubmission to source for downstream analysis purposes. 
 
### USING CURATED DATA TO ANSWER PROJECT’S QUESTION. 
The curated dataset contains books that featured on the best sellers list. This implies that, for the specified period of investigation, the type of books contained in the data are the most bought frequently. Knowing the type of books most bought frequently would be based on a defined criterion. These criteria include: 

▪ The Author of the book

▪ The type of cover worn by the book 

▪ The Title of the book
